## Professional Experience

### RDA Corporation (June 2010 - Present)

#### DLA Piper – Apache Cordova Mobile Application
* Developed a mobile intranet app using HTML5/Javascript, using a combination of Bootstrap 3 and AngularJS.
* Worked with a small team of developers to help them learn AngularJS using their mobile app as an example for generally accepted best practices and coding standards for AngularJS.
* Tested the application on a variety of different platforms, including iOS, Android and Blackberry 10, and used Cordova plugins where needed to provide specific functionality, such as geolocation and email composition.
* Used the Google Maps API v3 to provide office location maps and driving directions to an office using the users current location.
* Implemented functionality to provide a paged view of the employee directory, giving access to information on the client’s 10k+ employees.
* Communicated with a REST based API for various search features.

#### Jumptuit.com – iOS Application
* Developed an iOS application targeting the iPhone and iPad using the new Apple Swift language.
* Worked with the client to advise them of recommended design decisions according to common iOS use cases as well as the Apple User Interface Guidelines.
* Utilized a Universal storyboard to design an adaptable UI experience for all iOS devices.
* The application communicated with a REST API using the open source Alamofire library for networking and SwiftyJSON for handling the API results.
* Wrote a custom scroll view that was able to browse through any combination of photos, videos, music or documents available on the user’s account.
* Wrote a custom grid layout in order to display items in a collection view that spanned multiple rows and columns.
* Made use of several native iOS capabilities to provide a consistent and familiar UX experience
    * Used the UIActivityViewController for sharing generated links to various social media services.
    * Used the AVPlayerController for playing streaming video.
    * Used UICollectionView with multiple layouts that could be swapped at runtime to present cells in different formats (grid or list).
    * Used a tab bar for the primary navigation mechanism
    * Used “Swipe to Delete” where appropriate in the context of the UI.
* Implemented Twitter Crashylitics for capturing crash reports.

#### Greenway Health - EHR System
* Worked on various features, developing code both in an MVVM UI and the WCF/SQL Server backend.
* Served as a lead developer in the client’s dedicated performance team:  
    * Developed many significant performance enhancements and architectural changes to support a successful chain wide rollout of the EHR to all 8000+ their client’s stores.  Changes include optimization of Entity Framework queries, implementation of stored procedures to eliminate chatty DB access, implementation of caching static data and refactoring bloated code in order to promote reuse and ensure obsolete code was no longer being executed.
    * Architected a load-testing rig using Visual Studio for testing using web tests with an assortment of custom plugins.
    * Developed a Fiddler plugin to use for exporting highly customized web tests based on outgoing WCF traffic from the client application.  Between the Fiddler plugin and the custom web test plugin code, new scenarios could be captured via Fiddler, exported to new web tests and then immediately run with no manual modifications to the web tests.  The Fiddler exporter operated off of a custom designed XML mapping file that defined inputs/outputs that were needed for each of the WCF service calls made in the application, and the web tests would be exported with all necessary data binding expressions and extraction rules based on the contents of the mapping file.
    * Routinely conducted load tests in the performance environment using builds that had been delivered to QA for testing.  Results were compared to prior load test results in order to identity any new bottlenecks that needed to be addressed, as well as to monitor the trend in performance of many key WCF service calls over the course of several application versions.
    * Routinely reviewed new code for potential performance issues and worked with developers to help them analyze the performance impact and resolve bottlenecks.
    * Worked closely with Microsoft during several onsite performance lab engagements to fine tune the performance of the application and to utilize the appropriate load test strategies based off the throughput goals of the application.  During the lab engagements, we worked directly with SQL Server gurus, the Entity Framework team (amongst others).
    * Frequently utilized performance analysis tools such as the Visual Studio profiler, SQL profiler and NP Profiler to identify bottlenecks both in the code and in the database.
* Wrote a series of PowerShell scripts used to automate the configuration of new servers in an environment (including IIS, AppFabric, certificates and 3rd party software).  This made the process of standing up new environments much quicker and more consistent.  The scripts would take a vanilla install of Windows Server 2008 R2 and have it ready to host the application.
* Wrote a series of batch files to automate the deployment of new application versions to an entire server farm using MSDeploy. This eliminated a manual process and saved a significant amount of time from week to week when deploying builds to various server environments. 
* Served as one of the “go to” guys for a team consisting of 50+ developers.  I routinely participated in critical production working sessions, worked closely with other team members on best practices and troubleshooting issues, troubleshooting environmental issues both internally and within Walgreens environments due to my extensive knowledge of the system and the architecture.  
* Served as a release manager for several versions of the application.  Duties included building and deploying the application to various internal and client hosted server environments and coordinating with QA to quickly resolve issues and provide new builds on demand that contained specific fixes.
* Developed unit tests to ensure quality control throughout the development cycle.

#### Becton Dickinson - WPF Application
* Worked closely with the client during the requirements/design sessions for the project to define both the business requirements for the project as well as the detailed UI design.
* Worked with the client to design a database schema from scratch for use in a SQL Server Express database.
* Designed and implemented a data layer using Entity Framework 4 and the Repository/Unit of Work design patterns.
* Designed and implemented a UI for their medical technology device in WPF.  The UI was architected using the MVVM pattern.  This application was designed to run in a Kiosk mode since the application itself would run on each of their devices and host their own local database in SQL Server Express.
* Worked closely with the client and an external design firm to design the look and feel of the WPF UI and decide on the final design of art assets used in the UI.
* Served as a mentor to the team by assisting with design decisions, best practices and providing guidance on design patterns used throughout the application.
* Developed unit tests to ensure quality control throughout the development cycle. 
* Participated in numerous code reviews, both as a reviewer and a presenter.

#### USEC - Timecard Entry System
* Worked on both UI and server side code in a timecard entry application built using Silverlight/MVVM on the front end and RIA Services on the backend.
* Implemented complex workflows and business rules.

#### Becton Dickinson - WPF Application
* Assisted in developing a C# module for analyzing the results from a molecular testing device used to detect the presence of various STDs in a patient sample.
* Assisted in development of a WinForms UI that users used to control the workflow of the their devices. 
* Developed reports using ActiveReports to report results and lab workflow information from a SQL Server 2008 Express database.
* Developed unit tests for various algorithms used to analyze the results generated during molecular testing.
* Participated in numerous code reviews, both as a reviewer and a presenter.

### Constellation Energy (March 2008 - June 2010)

#### Analyst II - Application Development
* Built a custom .NET library on top of the PC Span API.  PC Span is a product built by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to use for calculating margin requirements on any given day based on a set of open trade positions, and an assortment of other variables such as market prices, risk factors, and more. 
* Developed a WCF service host to expose the Margin Calculation library, in order to expose the functionality to multiple applications.  Hosting the library in this fashion prevented the need for clients to install the software, as well as making it easier to maintain upgraded versions on the servers since it was hosted in one place. 
* Developed a C# front end in WPF to allow internal clients to build and run “What If” scenarios that take data from our internal trade systems and feed it into the Margin Calculation library.  Examples of scenarios are “What are our initial margin requirements for this set of books”, “What would our initial margin requirements be if we didn’t have the open positions in X, Y, and Z books”, and more.  The application allows them to set up the scenarios once, and run them for any business day going forward.  Historical calculation results are stored and viewable through the application.  The application was developed using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern in order to provide consistency in the development of the various pieces of the application, in addition to the low learning curve needed for delivering Phase 1 of the application in a short period of time. It uses a DevExpress NavBar and Grid, controls from the WPF Toolkit, and sports a tabbed interface with closable tabs based on a  "Workspaces" pattern for M-V-VM. 
* The Margin Calculator project replaced an old backend system that took several hours to run a typical scenario.  In comparison, the new application takes a matter of minutes to provide the same results, giving the users the tools necessary to run calculations on demand without having to prompt IT support to configure and schedule a scenario to be processed in the legacy system. 
* Developed a reusable class library for common tasks used in applications within the Constellation Commodities Group.  This included a database agnostic data layer, a parser for command line arguments, and more.  It also included a lightweight console application that could be used to launch pluggable tasks that implement the same interface (IBatchTask).  Task implementations can be for one or more tasks.  For tasks that need to process multiple items, tasks are run concurrently using the Microsoft Task Parallel Library to increase performance.  The command line application is primarily used as the executable for jobs scheduled via Procmon; a Unix based scheduling system. 
* Maintained a 3rd party application (http://www.acornsys.com) used for Activity Based Management within the Constellation New Energy department.  The application is hosted in Sharepoint 3.0 and uses a SQL Server 2005 cube.  Activities were mainly focused on gathering data from Constellations various systems and injecting it into Acorn for it to use for its’ Activity Based Costing model. 

### SM Consulting (February 2007 - March 2008)

#### Consultant – Constellation Energy Commodities Group
* Designed and developed a process that extracts scheduled wire payments from CEG’s Settlements system and issues payment instructions to various banks.  An existing C# windows service was extended to support running this process on a daily basis at 10am.  
* Assisted in designing and developing a Checkbook application.  A C# windows service was extended to support consuming prior day BAI files containing bank transactions from M&T and Citibank, parse the files, and store them in the Treasury database (Oracle 10g). The bank transactions are displayed in a Windows application where the users can view all activity for a particular date range by account.  Users are also able to manually enter checks and deposits, which are matched in the future when a matching transaction comes in a BAI file to show the check or deposit was processed.  In addition, the information is being sent to the CEG Settlements system in order to eliminate part of the manual process of daily reconciliation. 
* Designed and developed new features as required for the COG Framework, which is a C# windows application used as the “portal” for many financial reports within the Commodities Group.  In addition to new features and enhancements, I also provided support to users who had questions or issues with the application, but also provided support to developers who had questions about developing within the framework. 

### InOne Technology (April 2005 - February 2007)

#### Software Architect

* Oversaw the development of an ASP.NET Web application being completed by 4 offshore developers. Joined the company after the application had been in development for over a year. Managed the development, testing & deployment of new feature requests. Also, performed all research and development of new features to provide a richer Web based user experience, such as using Javascript/DHTML to allow a user to create and configure a vending machine layout and designate which products were in the vending machine’s columns. 
* Architected a new ASP.NET (C#) Web application from scratch, which replaced the aforementioned project. This involved a full database redesign (SQL Server 2000) and a new approach to software architecture. Managed 3 developers who were assigned tasks to develop specific parts of the application once the core architecture was in place. The site provides the following features: 
    * Allowed users to view the current inventory levels of their vending machines from the Web in near real time based on data reported from wireless devices installed in their machines. 
    * Based on certain user configurable conditions, determine which machines a user would have to visit on any given day. Conditions such as “total amount of cash in the machine” and “total columns vended out” would be evaluated to determine if a machine actually needed servicing. This allows a vending company to let the system dictate their service schedule, rather than having to go out and visit each machine on a regular basis to determine its inventory. The end result is a savings of time and money by reducing the amount of time the client spends managing their businesses. 
    * Allowed users to generate and print reports stating how many of each product they should take during vending machine service runs. The reports were developed using Microsoft SQL Reporting Services. The client can also generate reports that show product sales at various levels, such as company or specific location. 
    * Interested parties were notified via email or text message of various alert conditions, such as vendouts, machines overdue for service, power outages, etc. 
    * The application followed an ASP model, where each client had their own separate database. The application would determine which database it used based on their login
* Developed a C# WinForms application that read the data off of a handheld device using the Serial Port functionality of .Net 2.0.  The application would read the data (in the form of a DEX file) from the handheld device, then pass the data along to a web service which would then process the file upon receipt. The handheld device was used to capture data from 1 or more vending machines.  When the users got back to their PCs, they used the application to read and upload the data to InOne's server.
* Developed a Windows service in C#.NET that monitored a TCP port on our server for incoming calls from wireless devices installed in our customer’s vending machines. The TCP service accepts incoming transmissions and places them in a queue to be parsed and processed by the system. The service also has the ability to communicate back to a device and issue a new configuration, which can adjust how often the devices report its data, along with other parameters. 
* Developed a Windows service that would process “DEX” files reported in from wireless devices, parse them, and store the information into the database. A DEX file contains cumulative counters that would be incremented each time a vend occurred in a vending machine, and over time the information could be interpreted to determine the inventory levels of the machines. DEX files also contain various other information, such as alarms (“the coin mechanism jammed on X date/time”) which would be recorded and displayed for the users of the system. 
* Maintained development of an ASP.NET Website that acted as a “gateway” to our vending machine management software. It served as the authentication mechanism for logging into the application, and also kept a mapping of which wireless devices belonged to which customers. When DEX files were received on the server, they would be parsed and mapped to the appropriate customer’s database based on each wireless device’s 20 digit unique ID. 
* Maintained development of a handheld application written in Embedded C++. The handheld application allowed either a technician or an end user to query or configure the wireless devices that were installed in their vending machines. The handheld communicated with the device over a serial port connection, and was eventually tested to support the use of Bluetooth communication to eliminate the need for opening the vending machines and connecting the devices via a serial cable. 
* Involved with conducting Web based meetings to demonstrate company software to potential new users, as well as working with them to explain how our software and wireless devices would benefit their business. 

### RDA Corporation (April 2000 - April 2005)

#### Internal Applications - Merlin Accounting System
* Created an ASP.NET equivalent of RDA’s own Timecard application that was written in Java.  The aim of the project was to upgrade the application to the latest Microsoft technologies and eliminate the dependency on Microsoft’s JVM, because MS is officially dropping support for it.
* The project used C#, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, and SQL Server 2000.  An existing Microsoft data access component was leveraged to speed up the development cycle and ensure data access consistency.
* A custom ASP.NET DataGrid was developed to allow for the best possible user experience, which also leveraged JavaScript for real time client side total calculation and validation while entering weekly timecard data.  The DataGrid also used custom templates, including columns with dropdowns and textboxes for editing data.

#### Baltimore County Public Schools - User Management System

* Worked with internal developers to construct a replacement for the existing application security database schema that was determined to be no longer maintainable given the growing amount of applications in development and the currently flawed design.
* Constructed the Web architecture to support a Web-based interface for administering the security database.  Technologies uses were VB/ASP.NET, ADO.NET, and SQL Server 2000. The application is used to configure application security and roles, and allow/revoke access to individual users and titles.  The interface also allows the administrator and developers to get a report of who has access to what applications, and which applications an individual user has access to for security troubleshooting and auditing.  
The Web UI was built using a common template page approach, where a base page class is created and drives the layout of all other pages in the site, providing consistency in the user experience with reduced development time.
* Developed database schema and approximately 30 stored procedures.
* Developer a SQL Data Transformations package to synchronize the SQL application security database with any additions and updates to the Oracle Human Resources database.  This allowed automation of certain security rights and management procedures, because if Principals have access to a particular application, and a new principal was hired and entered into the HR system, then that user would automatically obtain all necessary application security rights based on his/her new title.
* Developed a managed .NET API to allow developers programmatic access to the security database in order to control privileged content access from their applications.
* Developed a prototype of a managed .NET component that allows for querying the Active Directory for accessing general user information, in addition to custom attributes belonging to the current logged in user.
* Continually assisted the internal developers with various issues during development of their own .NET applications.

#### Baltimore County Public Schools - Grant Tracking POC

* Personally mentored 2 VB6/COM+ developers to get up to speed on Microsoft.Net technology by demonstrating the differences between old and new technologies:
    * ASP.NET vs. ASP
    * ADO.NET vs. ADO 2.x
    * VS.NET vs. VB6
* Developed several small examples of each of the main topics, including an overview of Object Oriented design.
* Developed a comprehensive project plan for illustrating the timeline over which the proof of concept could become a functioning complete product.

#### MortgageRamp - Deal Central Lender System

* Assisted in composing the Architecture document for the Document Generation core service of the system.
* Designed and implemented a custom VB6 ActiveX DLL that uses Office Automation to construct various Loan level documents using a database driven mapping schema.
* Implemented a .NET Web Service that can be queried by the ActiveX component using the SOAP Client Toolkit (version 2). The Web service queries that database using ADO.NET, and retrieves information regarding the structure of the document, as well as the data to be inserted into the document.
* Implemented a custom class in VB6 that uses the low level functionality of the SOAP Client Toolkit in order to successfully contact a .NET Web service that requires SOAP header information to be supplied for authentication.
* Implemented a custom tool using .NET WinForms that was used to visually design the database mapping schema for the documents that can be generated by the system.  The tool made use of several WinForms components, including the TreeView, DataGrid, and Panels.  The TreeView was customized to allow re-arranging the node hierarchy via drag-n-drop, which would also update data relations in the persisted DataSet.  Different configuration panels would be displayed based on the type of TreeView node that was currently selected.  Data was persisted on the form via a strongly typed dataset which was originally retrieved via an initial Web Service call.  Controls on the form were bound to this dataset and changes to data in the tool would automatically reflect in the underlying data source.  The save operation would send the updated dataset by calling a Web service method which accepted the dataset as input.
* Assisted with development in various parts of the application, including ASP.NET Web pages and class libraries that include business components.

#### ASCE - Event Management System

* Participated in various meetings with the client during the analysis & design phase.
* Helped in constructing several areas of the Architecture document, including the Component view and Configuration view.
* Developed and maintained a custom build environment.  This consisted of a batch file that compiled, packaged, and automatically deployed the application to a BEA Weblogic server.
* Developed the Transaction Manager component of the application (the “Façade”).  The component accepted an XML request document from a Java servlet that included a method to call with parameters, and used that information to delegate calls to one of the Business objects, which were stateless session beans.  To facilitate the requirement for offline transaction logging, the Transaction Manager was also responsible for logging all incoming XML requests into the database, which could later be read by another server to synchronize the transactions by sending them back through the Transaction Manager on another system.  A custom HTML page was written that allows one machine to query another server and request transactions that it does not currently have recorded in its own database.  
* Implemented a custom NT service (written in Java and installed with a 3rd party utility) that would be used to monitor the transaction database and optionally record the transactions to a file on a hot swappable hard drive.  This would allow for a scenario where a laptop experienced a hardware failure and a backup laptop had to be quickly brought up.  The removable hard drive could be swapped into the second laptop, and a second NT service would monitor the hard drive and recognize the existence of a transaction log, and import those existing transactions.  This allowed for complete and total failsafe operation, and was thoroughly tested and proven to be rock solid in all scenarios.

#### Internal Consultant - Merlin 2000
* Merlin is a mission critical payroll application used internally at RDA.  The system is based on Java technology for the presentation and middle tiers, and uses SQL Server 2000 for the database layer.  The application uses Java applets (based on JDK 1.1.8 for Web browser compatibility) for the interface, which submit commands in XML format over HTTP to Java Servlets (based on JDK 1.2), which in turn manage data in a SQL 2000 database.  The application was hosted on Windows 2000 based servers.
* Maintained and continued development.
* Added functionality to create and edit weekly timecards, forecast work for upcoming months, manages project details and staff, and modifies system parameters that define how the application works.
* Upgraded the applets to use Java JDK 1.3.

#### Internal Consultant – Revenue Pipeline
* An application used internally by the RDA management team.  It is a Web-based financial application used to forecast revenue based on projects in the sales pipeline.  The application was developed with SQL Server 2000, IIS 5.0, ASP, Visual Basic 6, VBScript, C# and .NET.
* Led the effort to convert the web-based portion of the application to the new .NET framework using C#.
* Created a .NET version of the project using the latest technologies, including (but not limited to) C#, ASP.NET and ADO.NET.
* Used the COM+ Serviced Component to determine role membership and to restrict access to certain parts of the application.
* Built a customized data entry grid that allowed you to edit and save data in the grid.  This was displayed with standard HTML and the data manipulation was handled with ASP.NET.
* Allowed for new rows to be added to the grid and to perform data entry validation.
* Built a custom control for the navigation tabs at the top of the Web page, and added/removed tabs based on role membership at runtime.

#### Internal Consultant - Corporate Intranet
* A comprehensive company Intranet with both static and dynamic content as well as secure access to Web based applications using role based security, branch and line of business portals.
* Developed a piece of script that issues an LDAP query against active directory to obtain the time remaining for the logged on user before his/her password expired.
* Performed routine maintenance and development.
* Developed a security component written in Visual Basic 6 that allowed access to secured areas of the Website by checking membership in COM+ roles.

#### Internal Consultant – Online Status Reports
* Development of an application that allows employees to submit information for weekly status reports via the Web using a Java applet.  This eliminated the need for employees to write status reports using Word, and also ensured that status information was entered in a uniform format.
* Developed an interface based on Java applets using JDK version 1.1.8.
* Created a report component that used the integrated XML capabilities of SQL Server 2000 to generate report data in XML and format it for viewing in HTML format using XSLT style sheets.
* Developed business components that transferred data back and forth between the components and the Java applets via XML format.
* Implemented Windows Integrated Security for the application so that the application knew who the current user was by checking their current Windows logon and used their identity for database access.

#### Internal Consultant – Manual Payments
* An application used internally at RDA that allows a manager to submit monetary bonuses for employees.  Once the RDA Accounting department accepted bonuses, the bonuses would be automatically entered into the payroll system to be included in the recipient’s next paycheck.
* Developed COM+ middle tier component that used ADO to retrieve data from a SQL Server 2000 database.
* Developed a Java applet presentation layer based on JDK 1.1.8.  The applets sent XML requests to ASP pages over the Internet, and retrieved the results in XML format as well.

#### Internal Consultant – Proposal Automation
* An application used internally at RDA that allows executives and members of the sales team to track and manage proposals through a database defined workflow approval process.
* Converted an Outlook form used by the application to an ASP Web form.  This included manually converting all VBScript code used in the Outlook form to JavaScript so that the functionality was the same in both the Outlook and Web form.

#### Internal Consultant – RDA Wireless Web
* A prototype application used to demonstrate that static and dynamic database driven data could be viewed and manipulated from a wireless device.
* Developed a XML/XSLT framework for delivering wireless Web content tailored for various devices (Palm, Cell Phone, etc.).  
* Implemented a COM+ component that could verify user logon credentials against the domain.  If authenticated, the component would persist an access token that could be used to impersonate user identities for use in database access, etc.

### Absolute Quality, Inc. (April 1997 - April 2000)
